/**
 * The complete failure vocabulary the UI is allowed to render.
 *
 * Every layer above the API client speaks in `ErrorState`, never in raw
 * `Throwable`s: a screen that has to inspect exception types has a leak in it.
 * Repositories and use cases let exceptions propagate, and the base ViewModel
 * (`tryToExecute` / `tryToCollect`) converts them exactly once, at the boundary.
 *
 * EXTENSION POINT: add a case per failure a screen must react to *differently*.
 * If two cases would render the same message and the same retry affordance,
 * they are one case.
